# README-generator

## Description
- Motivation to build a README generator was based on the past couple of classes. Classes were taught on Node.js and how we can install & use dependencies to create applications.
- I built the README generator to take what I've learned these past couple of days during bootcamp. We learned that we can have dependecies to help make our app efficient. It helps build without having to build everything from scratch.
- This project solves the problem if you need to generate/create a readme file with the appropriate formatting and licensing used.

## Usage
- Run the app.
- Answer the following questions about your app you want to create a README for.
- Once you have finished answering the questions correctly. A README will generate.
- See screenshot below as example
